My proposal for this project is a basketball shooting game. Using cinder, I want to create an app using cinder where players can use either the mouse or the keys to shoot a ball into a hoop with a running score.

My background knowledge for this project comes from the fact that I love basketball but I also used to love these games where I could shoot on the screen, and I believe it will be really cool if I could make one of those games myself. 

My goal for week 1 is to implement the regular shooting portion, where something in the shape of a hoop and a ball is displayed and that ball can move in the direction of the hoop. I will have to learn how to implement moving the ball from the player's control, whether it is through a mouse or a key with a meter displayed for direction and power. By week 2 I would want to implement a scoreboard and add effects such as the rim moving and an end to the game if a player does not hit a certain amount of their shots. By week 3 I would want to add a leaderbard and add other potential effects to make the game look more appealing such as adding a court background.
